# Neo4j Graphs from publication "Smart Cities Under Threat: A Systematic Review and Conceptual Risk Model" 

This repository contains two Neo4j graph models derived from scientific literature:
* A smart city technology graph
* A smart safe city risk graph

## Smart city technology graph
The smart city technology graph illustrates the four key layers of smart city infrastructure:
- the sensing layer: contains devices, digital technologies, and sensors
- the data transmission layer: includes various communication protocols
- the data management: covers different digital technologies used for data analysis, storage, and management
- the application layer: includes digital technologies

The graph legend with the explanation for node colours can be seen in `legend.png`
